          <h2>Ingeredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean
              ground beef.
            </li>
            <li>
              Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked
              with the meat to add tons of flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and
              enhance the flavor of the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh
              parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel
              seeds, and black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this
              lasagna extra decadent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the
              lasagna when you cut into it.
            </li>
          </ul>
